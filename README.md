# RMLops: A simple R example for Azure Pipelines

This is the Github repository associated with this Azure Pipelines project: https://dev.azure.com/davidsmi0786/davidsmiRtest. It is intended as a simple example
of using R with Azure Pipelines to use a CI/CD process to trigger training of a
predictive model.
